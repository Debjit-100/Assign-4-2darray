To rearrange the array nums in the given form [x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., xn, yn], you can create a new array and iterate over nums using two pointers. Here's the solution in JavaScript:

javascript
Copy code
function shuffle(nums, n) {
  const result = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    result.push(nums[i]);
    result.push(nums[i + n]);
  }
  return result;
}

// Test case
const nums = [2, 5, 1, 3, 4, 7];
const n = 3;
const shuffledArray = shuffle(nums, n);
console.log(shuffledArray); // Output: [2, 3, 5, 4, 1, 7]
The shuffle function takes an array nums and an integer n as input. It initializes an empty array result to store the rearranged elements.

It then iterates over nums from index 0 to n - 1. In each iteration, it pushes nums[i] (the xi element) and nums[i + n] (the yi element) to the result array.

Finally, it returns the result array that now contains the elements rearranged in the required form.

In the given example, the output will be [2, 3, 5, 4, 1, 7] as the xi elements are [2, 5, 1] and the yi elements are [3, 4, 7]. The function creates a new array with elements in the order [2, 3, 5, 4, 1, 7], which matches the desired form.
